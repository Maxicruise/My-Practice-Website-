     <h2>Instructions</h2>
     <ol>
       <li>Begin by combining the flour, baking powder, sugar and salt in a large bowl. Whisk to combine.</li>
       <li>In another bowl, whisk together the eggs and milk.</li>
       <li>Pour the wet ingredients and melted butter into the dry ingredients, then give it a quick stir—just enough to moisten everything. Don’t worry if you see a few lumps; that’s exactly how it should be. If you mix too much, the pancakes can turn out tough. The batter will be on the thick side, but if it feels too thick, just add a splash more milk.</li>
       <li>Heat a griddle or large nonstick skillet over medium heat, then lightly coat it with vegetable oil and swirl in a thin pat of butter. Scoop about ¼ cup of batter for each pancake and pour it onto the skillet. Let them cook until the bottoms turn golden brown and the tops start bubbling with little holes—that’s your sign they’re ready to flip.</li>
       <li>Flip the pancakes and cook until the other side is golden brown—this happens fast, so take a peek after about 30 seconds and keep an eye on them. Repeat with the remaining batter, wiping the pan clean with paper towels between batches. Serve right away while they’re crispy on the outside and soft inside, with a pat of butter and a drizzle of maple syrup, if you like.</li>
       <li>Leftover pancakes freeze beautifully for a quick breakfast later. Just let them cool completely on a wire rack, then stack them with parchment or wax paper in between to prevent sticking. Wrap them tightly in foil or pop them into a freezer bag. When you’re ready to enjoy, reheat them in a single layer on a foil-lined baking sheet at 375°F for 8 to 10 minutes, until they’re warmed through and ready to serve.</li>
